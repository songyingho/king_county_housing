High Level Overview:
Before starting the project, 3 questions were formulated to be answered by the conclusion of the project. Data was cleaned by extracting useful information from existing columns, removing duplicated rows, filling missing values, changing data types, checking and removing rows with incorrect values. Subsequently, we explored the data and created useful visualization for presentation. Finally, we tested several simple regression model and created a multi variable linear regression model to improve our existing model.
